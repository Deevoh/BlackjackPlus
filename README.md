# Blackjack+

The second personal project of mine. It's a simple blackjack game that includes an additional scoring mechanic and bidding. There is no split action in this modified version. Score as close to 21 points as possible without going over and busting. If the player decides to hold while having the same suits in their hand, an additional scoring round is initiated and ten points are added on top of the total card rank value. This allows the player to potentially turn around a loss and win up to 2x their bid.


## **To Do**

- Fix double ace bug (Value of 22 is a win)
- Choose ace value at 1 or 11?
- Automatic blackjack at 21.
- Clean up code and create more coherent functions.
- Make sure all special scoring conditions are met.
- Add another mechanic for matching ranks?
- Add dealer special scoring conditions?
