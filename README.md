# Blackjack+

The second personal project of mine. It's a simple blackjack game that includes an additional scoring mechanic and bidding. There is no split action in this modified version. Score as close to 21 points as possible without going over and busting. If the player decides to hold while their hand includes all similar suits, an additional scoring round is initiated and ten points are added on top of the total card rank value. This allows the player to potentially turn around a loss and win up to 2x their bid.


## **To Do**

- Clean up sloppy code and create more coherent functions.
- Make sure all special scoring conditions are met.
- Add another mechanic for matching ranks? Maybe a special scoring condition for the dealer?
