# Blackjack+

The second personal project of mine. It's a simple blackjack game that includes an additional scoring mechanic and bidding.


## **To Do**

- Implement bidding.
- Fix loop issues.
- Clean up code and create more coherent functions.
- Add dealer RNG, possibly picking a value between 16-18 and holding?
